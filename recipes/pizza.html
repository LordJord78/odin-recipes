    <h3>Instructions for cooking</h3>
    <h3>Making the Dough</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Ingredients: You'll need flour (all-purpose or bread flour), active dry yeast, warm water, salt, olive oil, and optionally, a pinch of sugar.</li>
            <li>Activate the yeast: Dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water. Allow it to sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes foamy, indicating the yeast is active.</li>
            <li>Combine ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and salt. Add the activated yeast mixture and olive oil.</li>
            <li>Form and knead the dough: Mix the ingredients until a soft dough forms. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for a few minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Let the dough rise: Place the dough in a greased bowl, turning to coat it with oil. Cover and let it rise in a warm place until doubled in size (usually about 45 minutes to 1 hour).</li>
            <li>Punch down the dough: Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release the air.</li>
            <li>Shape the dough: Divide the dough in half (if making two pizzas) and press or roll each half into the desired shape and thickness on a greased pizza pan or a surface dusted with cornmeal.</li>
